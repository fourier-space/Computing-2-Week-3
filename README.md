# Computing 2 â€“ Week 3

## Setup
As normal make sure to install your external dependancies
```bash
npm install
npm install --prefix web-app/common
```

## Wednesday
In this repo, I've initally uploaded a shell of `Connect4.js`,
which is the API as it appears in Zombie Siege but without any implementation.
I've also included an empty `Game_module.js` if you wanted to use this to test
your jsdoc.
